File Descriptions:
    lab1b_client.c
        This is a client program that passes inputs from the user to the server program and outputs from the server program to client
        through a TCP socket. The implementation is based on lab 1a, except we no longer rely on pipes to pass I/O between processes; instead
        sockets are used to pass I/O between client and server. The compress option supports compression via the zlib package which allows
        communication to take up less bandwidth. The log option is used to track compression. 

    lab1b_server.c
        This is the server program that relays I/O from client to server and back through TCP sockets and I/O between the shell and 
        parent processes through the same pipes we used in lab 1a. The compress option supports compression via the zlib package which 
        allows communication to take up less bandwidth. 

    Makefile
        This is a standard makefile that supports compilation (for individual files and all together), cleaning, and archiving relevant 
        files.
