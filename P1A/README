    lab1a.c
        Contains source code for project specifications. I tried to make main() as minimal as possible and keeping the bulk of the work to helper functions. 
        I also centralized system call checks under one function with error codes as macros to make things easier. I didn't want to use global variables, 
        but for the sake of modularity I think it was a good tradeoff to make. As a high level explanation of the code, the program in shell mode sets the terminal
        into no echo non-canonical mode and then forks a child process which connects pipes between the terminal and the shell and the shell back to the terminal
        After this is all accomplished, it executes the shell. We use poll() to manage input sources. Control-D and Control-C cause exits. I definitely had the most
        trouble managing the pipes and it caused some insidious errors that had me shaking and crying. But it all worked out in the end.

    Makefile
        Generic makefile that supports compiling with -Wall -Wextra flags, compressing into a tarbell, and cleaning files
